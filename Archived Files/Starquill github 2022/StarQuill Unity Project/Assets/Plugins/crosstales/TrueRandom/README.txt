## Description
This is the first asset that gives you the chance to generate real- and not just pseudo random like Unity does. Generate random numbers, sequences and strings just as simple as the normal Unity random.

### Why use True Random?

True Random can generate "true random2 numbers for you and your application. 
The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs. 
People use True Random for holding drawings, lotteries and sweepstakes, to drive online games, for scientific applications and for art and music.


### How does this differ from Unity Random?
 
Perhaps you have wondered how Unity can generate randomness. In reality, random numbers used in Unity are pseudo-random, 
which means they are generated in a predictable fashion using a mathematical formula.

This is fine for many purposes, but it may not be random in the way you expect if you're used to dice rolls and lottery drawings.

Please read the "TrueRandom-doc.pdf" and "TrueRandom-api.pdf" for more details.

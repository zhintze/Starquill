# Scope Document

## Game Title

Starquill

## Genre

Open-World Fantasy RPG

## High Concept

An open-world fantasy RPG focused on exploration, looting, and emergent storytelling, with a dynamically generated world that responds to player discovery and interaction.

## Platform(s)

**Android**  
Supports high-volume of assets and allows future expansion into Web3 (wallet, token, NFTs).

#### Character Stats (D&D-Inspired)

- **Strength (STR)** – Physical power, used for lifting, forcing, breaking, and physical presence  
- **Dexterity (DEX)** – Agility, reflexes, precision, and balance. Influences finesse and speed-based actions  
- **Constitution (CON)** – Stamina, resistance, and physical durability. Affects how long one can endure hardship  
- **Intelligence (INT)** – Reasoning, memory, and knowledge of the world. Governs logic and problem-solving  
- **Wisdom (WIS)** – Perception, awareness, and instinct. Used to read the world and anticipate events  
- **Charisma (CHA)** – Presence, influence, and emotional resonance. Drives interactions and persuasion  

## Dice-Based Resolution

- All interactions and content triggers (loot quality, dialogue branches, event outcomes) roll against relevant stats  
- Traditional **d20 system** or custom probability tables  
- Modifiers based on traits, equipment, or party members  
- Used in:
  - Exploration outcomes (e.g., discovering hidden areas)
  - Dialogue decisions and NPC reactions
  - Loot rarity and item quality
  - Triggering or avoiding environmental events  

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. Explore a procedurally generated world  
2. Discover unique locations  
3. Loot items and resources  
4. Interact with NPCs (optional)  
5. Trigger emergent content or quests via interaction (optional)  
6. Trade loot to gain better loot  
7. Repeat the loop  

## Core Features

- Character Layer display system 
- Procedural world generation  
- Location and POI spawning logic
- **Inventory system and loot mechanics** 
- Simple NPCs with dialog triggers  
- Basic quest/content triggering from NPC interaction 

## Future Features

- **Economy and barter/trade system**

- **LLM AI Integration**  
  
  - Dynamic NPC dialog  
  - AI-generated plot and events  
  - Adaptive player choices and world state  

- **Web3 Integration**  
  
  - NFT character/item minting  
  - Crypto token as core currency  
  - Online NFT marketplace  

- **Narrative System**  
  
  - Incorporation of *The 36 Dramatic Situations* framework  
  - Combined with AI plot generator for deep emergent stories  

## Out of Scope (For the foreseeable future)

- Multiplayer functionality  

- Real-time combat or action-based mechanics

- Console Ports

- VR Support

## Visual Style

**Paper Doll Fantasy**  

- Characters are minimally animated (e.g., physics like popsicle stick puppets)  
- Stylized and modular for easy asset swapping and customization

## Audio Style

Whimsical fantasy gnome music with MIDI-inspired instrumentation

## Resources & Tools

- **Engine**: Godot  
- **Source Control**: GitHub  
- **Task Tracking**: Taiga  
- **Audio Assets**: _(TBD)_  
- **Image Assets**: _(TBD)_
- **Communication**: Discord

## Known Risks

- Risk of scope creep due to modular system and AI possibilities  
- Lack of defined combat or challenge mechanics could affect engagement  
- High volume of image assets may challenge optimization

## Player Fantasy & Emotional Goals

- A sense of wonder while exploring the unknown  
- Satisfaction of finding and collecting rare loot  
- Freedom to shape a personal journey through NPC interactions  
- Curiosity-driven storytelling through AI-generated content
